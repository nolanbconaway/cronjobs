# Cron Jobs

This repo contains the cron jobs that run on my personal desktop. Everything runs via the `run` script, which sets up the environment and executes whatever I like in python. 

The crontab lives in `jobs.crontab`, which I manually use to overwrite my crontab file with the `deploy` script.

If I get more than a handful of jobs in here, maybe I'll implement an airflow server!
